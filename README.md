<h1><p align="center"> Give - ActiveCampaign Add-on 📧 </p></h1>

<p align="center">ActiveCampaign is one of the most popular email marketing platforms available. This add-on allows you to integrate your donation forms with ease so that your donors are provided an option to opt-in when giving. When activated you can customize the lists and tags donors are assigned when they give on a global and per form basis, modify the opt-in display text, and more.</p>
